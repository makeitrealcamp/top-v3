# Factorial

Write a function called `factorial` that receives a number and returns the factorial of the number. The factorial is the multiplication of every positive number up to the number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 120 because `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`.

```javascript
console.log(factorial(4)); // 24
console.log(factorial(5)); // 120
console.log(factorial(6)); // 720
console.log(factorial(9)); // 362880
```
